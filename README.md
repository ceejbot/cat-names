# cat-names

Do you need random cat names, perhaps to respond to ping endpoints in your otherwise drab, dull services? You could use [Culture ship names](https://github.com/ceejbot/gsv-culture-ships), or you could use adorable cat names!

## Usage

```rust
let catname = cat_names::name();
println!("Congratulations! Your new kitten is named {}.", catname);
```

`cargo run --example kitten` to name your new kitten.
